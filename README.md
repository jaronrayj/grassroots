*Description:* Grassroots is a community optimizing application that allows users to create, join, and share community project templates. By accessing our database, users have access to all community projects created so that they can organize their ideas and become inspired by what others are doing.

*Motivation:* This project solves the issue of communities burning out in their constant ways of outreach. Communities can see what is working across the US and better serve their local community.

*Results:* Our end result is a very standard template organizer and database that streamlines the creation of community service projects. We have authentication to keep userâ€™s projects and information secure and safe. 

*Team Efforts:* In the beginning we brainstormed ideas for this project after Dan M. had pitched the initial idea. Dan was also the Team Lead and organized the in order to have an M.V.P. done and produced before the second week. The work was divided democratically based off of what individuals wanted to learn, accomplish, and improve upon. Throughout the process, the team constantly worked together and we would fluidly work together on pieces as well as focus individually on our own responsibilities.
